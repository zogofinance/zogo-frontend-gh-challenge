# A frontend coding challenge using GitHub's api

Thanks for accepting our challenge! This challenge should take no longer than 3 hours.

The goal of this exercise is to practice designing models and interfaces, and to get a feel for how you build on the frontend.

There aren't good or bad solutions; rather, there are solutions that match the requirements and some that don't. There are solutions that might be considered elegant by some and solutions that would be considered clever.

You can use GitHub's free api for this exercise (ex: `https://api.github.com/users/simonkomlos`)

### The exercise: generate a GitHub user profile

Your challenge is to code a GitHub profile page. The profile should be able to support any user whether they have a lot of information or not.

This is an example wireframe.. <b>This is really important: this wireframe is an example of what can be done within the time frame, but it is absolutely not the benchmark. Build what you can in a reasonable amount of time. </b>

If you're someone who loves css and beautifying the UI, show us that. Approach this task as your way of displaying your favorite parts of frontend development.

#### Required Features

Your profile page should include the following features:

 - [ ] A way to input/search a GitHub user
 - [ ] Display user's name, avatar, bio, location.
 - [ ] Showcase a list of the user's repos with their name, prodominent language, # of forks, and # of watchers.
 
 #### Extra mile
 
 If you have done all the required features and want to keep going because you just made a cool profile page, try doing the following:
 
* Have a tab feature (as in the wireframe) that changes the view
* Add a way to sort through the list of repos (could be an input field or could be by asc/desc order)
* Add loading spinners while the information is loading

### What can I use & what are we looking for?

* The only requirement is that you use Angular. You can use any plugins & libraries. 
* You can build the app as a desktop or mobile view.. or you can make it responsive.. but that's absolutely up to you!
* Please include a readme. If we need to run the code locally to see it work, please give us instructions.
* Please use this exercise as a way to show us what you like about frontend development. Some people live for performance, others for accessibility, or great UI/UX or writing tests. We are aware of the time constraint, if what you love takes time, put comments in.

### Submitting your solution

As soon as you're ready, send us a link to your repo (either a fork of this repo or a new one that you created). You don't have to send us the link before you're ready, but we recommend committing code early and often, with clear descriptive commit messages. This helps us follow your thought process as you build your solution.
